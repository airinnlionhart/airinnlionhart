I'm Aaron, an operations engineer(Site Reliability Engineer/ IT) with nine years of experience in the tech industry. I specialize in product engineering, observability, and cloud development, crafting solutions that ensure smooth operations and optimal performance. Passionate about leveraging technology to drive efficiency and innovation, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise to solve complex challenges. Let's connect and collaborate on building the future of technology together! ðŸ’»âœ¨

As a Site Reliability Engineer II at Snagajob, I specialize in elevating the reliability and performance of our services. Collaborating with development teams, I establish clear service levels and monitoring objectives, fostering actionable alerts and a significant reduction in incident noise. Proactively utilizing observability tools, I ensure the robust security of our services and provide critical data to prioritize enhancements. My contributions extend to optimizing infrastructure, preventing service abuse, fostering cost savings, and breaking down silos to promote a cohesive and reliable operational environment. <img src="https://github.com/airinnlionhart/airinnlionhart/assets/49368013/ca08d47a-c49d-4404-92d4-c9e44fa6cf79" width=200 height=200px align="right"/>

Just to make sense of some of the Repos I have been working on. 5 relate to a tech degree in Python https://teamtreehouse.com/profiles/aaronlenhart;  I have refactor some of them to better follow OOP best practices.
